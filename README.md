# VM-Series Golden Configuration via Strata Cloud Manager

## Overview

This Terraform project deploys a comprehensive "golden configuration" to a Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewall in AWS through **Strata Cloud Manager (SCM)**. It demonstrates how every aspect of a next-generation firewall can be automated as Infrastructure-as-Code using the `PaloAltoNetworks/scm` Terraform provider.

This project has been validated end-to-end against the SCM API (provider v1.0.8) and commits cleanly from a shared folder.

## Prerequisites

1. **Strata Cloud Manager tenant** with a VM-Series firewall onboarded
2. **Service account** with API access ([create one here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/common-services/identity-and-access-access-management/manage-identity-and-access/add-service-accounts))
3. **Terraform** >= 1.4.6
4. **SCM Provider** >= 1.0.8 (auto-downloaded by `terraform init`)

## Authentication

Export the following environment variables before running Terraform:

```bash
export SCM_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export SCM_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
export SCM_TSG_ID="your-tsg-id"
export SCM_SCOPE="tsg_id:your-tsg-id"
```

> **Important:** `SCM_SCOPE` must be the literal string `tsg_id:<your-tsg-id>`. Do **not** use shell variable interpolation or Terraform variables for the scope value — the API will reject it.

## Usage

```bash
# Initialize the provider
terraform init

# Preview changes (update folder to match your SCM container)
terraform plan -var="folder=ngfw-shared"

# Deploy the golden config
terraform apply -var="folder=ngfw-shared"

# Push the candidate config in SCM to make it active
# (This step is done in the SCM UI or via the scm_config_versions resource)
```

## Customization

Edit `variables.tf` to adjust:

- `folder` — SCM folder targeting your firewall (default: `ngfw-shared`)
- `trusted_network` — Your internal CIDR (default: `10.0.0.0/8`)
- `dmz_network` — Your DMZ CIDR (default: `172.16.0.0/16`)
- `aws_vpc_cidr` — Your AWS VPC CIDR (default: `10.100.0.0/16`)
- `dns_servers` — Your DNS server IPs
- `nat_egress_ip` — The untrust interface IP for outbound source NAT (default: `10.100.0.10/32`)

## Known Limitations

- **Antivirus/WildFire profiles** cannot be created via the SCM API. Create them manually in SCM and reference by name in the profile groups. The default `best-practice` profile is used here.
- **URL Filtering profiles** (`scm_url_access_profile`) are read-only data sources in the current provider version. Create them manually in SCM.
- **Config push** — Terraform creates a candidate configuration. You must push/commit it in SCM to activate it on the firewall.

## SCM Provider Gotchas

The following behaviors were discovered through testing against the live SCM API (v1.0.8). The Terraform Registry documentation does not always surface these constraints, since the docs are JS-rendered and difficult to scrape. Actual `terraform apply` error output remains the most reliable schema reference for this provider.

### Security Rules (`scm_security_rule`)

- **`source_user` is required.** The Terraform schema marks it as optional, but the SCM API rejects any security rule that omits it. Always include `source_user = ["any"]`.
- **`category` is required and cannot be empty.** Setting `category = []` or omitting it entirely both cause API errors. Always include `category = ["any"]`.

### Address Objects (`scm_address`)

- **`ip_wildcard` type does not support tags.** Adding a `tag` attribute to an address object using `ip_wildcard` will fail with an "Invalid Object" error. All other address types (ip_netmask, ip_range, fqdn) support tags normally.

### Ethernet Interfaces (`scm_ethernet_interface`)

- **Interface names use template variable format.** SCM expects names like `$ethernet1_1`, not PAN-OS format `ethernet1/1`. The slash character fails regex validation.
- **Template variables require device-level mappings.** Interfaces defined with `$variable` names can only be committed when the target folder/container has a device with matching variable definitions. Pushing from a generic shared folder will fail at commit time with "unresolved variables" errors.
- **For AWS VM-Series, interfaces are bootstrapped.** In most AWS deployments, interface configuration is handled via init-cfg.txt/userdata and is device-specific. Interface resources are included in this project as commented-out examples for reference.

### NAT Rules (`scm_nat_rule`)

- **Avoid `interface_address` in shared folders.** Interface-based source NAT (`interface_address = { interface = "..." }`) requires resolved template variables. For folder-based configs, use `translated_address` with an address object instead.
- **`dynamic_ip_and_port.translated_address` is a list of strings**, not a nested object. The correct syntax is:
  ```hcl
  source_translation = {
    dynamic_ip_and_port = {
      translated_address = ["My-NAT-Address"]
    }
  }
  ```

### Vulnerability Protection Profiles (`scm_vulnerability_protection_profile`)

- **`default = {}` is not a valid action for rules.** Although it appears in the schema documentation, the API rejects it in the `rules` block. Use a concrete action (`allow`, `alert`, `drop`, `reset_both`, etc.) instead. The `default` action is only valid inside `threat_exception` blocks.

### File Blocking Profiles (`scm_file_blocking_profile`)

- **Not all file type keywords are valid.** For example, `ps1` (PowerShell) is not recognized as a valid file type. Validate file type keywords against your PAN-OS/SCM version before using them.
- **Application names in file blocking rules follow App-ID naming.** Generic names like `ssl` are not valid — use the specific App-ID name (e.g., `web-browsing`). Check the App-ID database in SCM for valid application names.

### General Tips

- **The Terraform Registry docs for this provider are JS-rendered** and cannot be fetched by automated tools or scraped reliably. When in doubt, run `terraform plan`/`apply` against the real API — the error messages are the most accurate schema documentation available.
- **Iterate with `terraform apply -parallelism=1`** when debugging. This serializes API calls and makes error output easier to follow.
- **SCM authentication rate limits** apply to JWT token requests (~10 concurrent). For CI/CD pipelines, consider the token caching approach described in the provider's GitHub README.

## Security Posture Summary

The golden config implements a **defense-in-depth** strategy:

1. **Network segmentation** — Three zones with zone protection profiles
2. **Application-aware policy** — App-ID based rules, not port-based
3. **Threat prevention on every rule** — Anti-spyware, IPS, DNS security, file blocking
4. **Least privilege** — Explicit deny-all at the bottom of the rulebase
5. **Anti-spoofing** — RFC1918 blocking on untrust ingress + zone protection
6. **Protocol enforcement** — QUIC blocked to force TLS inspection
7. **SSL/TLS best practice** — TLS 1.2 minimum, no RC4, no 3DES
8. **Comprehensive logging** — All rules log to SIEM via log forwarding profiles
